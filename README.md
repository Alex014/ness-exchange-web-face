## How it works

What you see is a web-face of an exchange system. The web face is used to create new tokens and display olready created tokens. Main part of the system is a token processor, a place where tokens get's processed and payed, and it's located on a different machine without a public IP address.

# Advantages of tokens

* Token with your contract will stay in blockchain forever. If you put anything in a blockchain, it will stay there forever, this is how the blockchain works. This also means that nobody can delete the token.
* You can always proove ownership. You can prove ownership of the token by signing any piece of data with your NESS address.
* You can always check the balance of your NESS address.
* The token can be processed manualy. If everything fails, the token can be processed (payed) and checked manualy.
* You can't hack this exchange unless you don't know where the token processor is located.

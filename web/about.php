                <h3>How it works</h3>
                <p>
                What you see is a web-face of an exchange system. 
                The web-face is used to create new Tokens and display already created Tokens.
                The main part of the system is a Token processor, a place where Tokens get processed and payed. It's located on a different machine without a public IP address.
                </p>

                <h3>Advantages of Tokens</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                    Token with your contract will stay in blockchain forever.
                    If you put anything in a blockchain, it will stay there forever, this is how the blockchain works.
                    This also means that nobody can delete the Token.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    You can always prove ownership.
                    You can prove ownership of the Token by signing any piece of data with your NESS address.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    You can always check the balance of your NESS address.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    The Token can be processed manually.
                    If everything fails, the Token can be processed (payed) and checked manually.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    You can't hack this exchange unless you know where the Token processor is located.
                    </li>
                </ul>

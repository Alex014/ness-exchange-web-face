                <h3>How it works</h3>
                <p>
                What you see is a web-face of an exchange system. 
                The web face is used to create new tokens and display olready created tokens.
                Main part of the system is a token processor, a place where tokens get's processed and payed, and it's located on a different machine without a public IP address.
                </p>

                <h3>Advantages of tokens</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                    Token with your contract will stay in blockchain forever.
                    If you put anything in a blockchain, it will stay there forever, this is how the blockchain works.
                    This also means that nobody can delete the token.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    You can always proove ownership.
                    You can prove ownership of the token by signing any piece of data with your NESS address.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    You can always check the balance of your NESS address.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    The token can be processed manualy.
                    If everything fails, the token can be processed (payed) and checked manualy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    You can't hack this exchange unless you don't know where the token processor is located.
                    </li>
                </ul>
